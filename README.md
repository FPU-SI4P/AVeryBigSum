Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers of size N. You need to print the sum of the elements of the array.

Note: A signed 32-bit integer value uses 1st bit to represent the sign of the number and remaining 31 bits to represent the magnitude. The range of the 32-bit integer is −231 to 231−1 or [−2147483648,2147483647]. When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed this range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.

Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The next lines contain N space separated integers describing the array.

Constraints 
1≤N≤10 
0≤A[i]≤1010

Output Format

Output a single value equal to the sum of the elements of the array.
